# Show Night

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how implement android projects by using Clean Architecture principles, MVVM pattern, Android best practices, Jetpack, and design patterns.

It is less about the application and more about the code and architecture.

The goal is showcase object oriented programming in Kotlin and Android including:
- Reactive programming with [Rxjava 2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) and [RxAndroid 2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid)
- Dependency Injection with [Daggger 2](https://github.com/google/dagger)
- Networking with [Retrofit 2](https://github.com/square/retrofit)
- De/Serialization with [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson)
- Image loading with [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)
- Writing code using [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) and [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) pattern
- Using [Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin)
- Using Android Jetpack Components: [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx.html), [Lifecycles](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle), [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata), [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel), [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room), [Fragments](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments)
